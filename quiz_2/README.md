# Analysis of the prices of Bordeaux wines
## Modelling the price of wine using Robert Parker and Clive Coates's ratings and Pomerol district.

Robert Parker and Clive Coates, two renowned wine critics from the USA and UK 
respectively, are believed to influence Bordeaux wine prices in the UK market 
with their ratings. In this question, we consider the prices (in pounds 
sterling £) of 72££ wines from the 2000 vintage in Bordeaux, a vintage 
celebrated for its exceptional quality. Many wines from this year are 
exhilarating in quality, with the finest offering an impressive longevity 
of 30-40 years

The dataset is given in the Bordeaux.csv file below:

We will focus on the following variables:
- `Price`: the price (in pounds sterling ££) of 1212 bottles of wine,
- `ParkerPoints`: Robert Parker's rating (out of 100100),
- `CoatesPoints`: Clive Coates’ rating of the wine (out of 20)
- `Pomerol`: bool, takes value 1 if the wine is from Pomerol (a district of 
Bordeaux) and takes value 0 otherwise,
    
Load this dataset in R and answer the questions in Part 1.
