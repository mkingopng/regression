- point estimates
- interva estimates

**The weibull distribution** is a continuous probability distribution. It is 
named after Swedish mathematician Waloddi Weibull, who described it in detail 
in 1951, although it was first identified by Fr√©chet (1927) and first applied 
by Rosin & Rammler (1933) to describe a particle size distribution. It is 
related to a number of other probability distributions; in particular, it 
interpolates between the exponential distribution (k = 1) and the Rayleigh 
distribution (k=2).

Weibull is commonly used for times to failure (or survival times).
