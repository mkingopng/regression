# What Does Ninevah Mean?
Ninevah was the capital city of the Assyrian Empire, the first dynasty of the 
Achmenid-Persian Empire.

The assyrian empire was short-lived but high-impact. In 100 years, starting 
under Sennacherib in 729 BC, the Assyrians punctuated the end of the 
bronze age and the beginning of the iron age. 

Sennacherib proceeded to level Babylon, and conquer Egypt and most of the 
eastern Mediterranean.

They are the last empire that practiced conspicuous brutality as a foreign 
policy, something that had been standard practice prior. 

Their successors, the persians, represent the first great power in the ancient 
rule to use diplomacy rather than brutality. Their later interactions with 
ancient greece, most famously at Thermopylae (300). This interaction with 
Persia, first under Darius then Xerxes was a defining element of Greek, 
particularly Athenian cultural development.

Ben is already persuaded of the beauty and significance of Greek cultural 
legacy. But I'd go a lot further. If we didn't have the persians, then we not only 
* don't have athenian democracy, 
* we also don't have judaism, christianity or islam.

The assyrians are the bridge: the bridge between the old and the very very old.
